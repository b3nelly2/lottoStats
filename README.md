# Lotto Stats

This was a project inspire by discussions with friends that play the lottery and wondering what certain stats were for numbers drawn. I decided to use my new JavaScript ES6 skills to generate some stats for Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries. Not much effert put in to the design as this was more of a programming challenge for myself.
